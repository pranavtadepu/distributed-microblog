# distributed-microblog

# Client
CLI has 3 subcommands:
post message [file-to-attach]
if file-to-attach is given, it will be base64 encoded before sending to the server.
list [--starting id] [--count number] [--save-attachment]
if --save-attachment is given, a file will be created with the base64 decoded attachment named message-id.out
the number of messages to retrieve may be greater than 20, so you may need to make additional requests under the covers. number defaults to 10.
if --starting is not give, start at the end.
messages will be listed in the following way:
100: 2024-03-13T19:38-07:00 author_name says "this message may go multiple lines
that's okay. make sure to end with a quote. if there is an attachment
put a ðŸ“Ž emoji after the quote and a space." ðŸ“Ž
create userid
will generate a public key pair and save the userid and private key to a mb.ini file that will be used later by post and list if the create is successful. the userid must consist of only lowercase letters and numbers.
# Message Signing
The digest was calculated over the JSON of the message with the fields:
"date", "author", "message", and  "attachment" in order. 
All whitespace for formatting are removed before calculating the SHA-256 digest and signed with RSA.
